# Power Pixels: a turnkey pipeline for processing of Neuropixel recordings âš¡
ðŸ“„ Please cite the [bioRxiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.27.661890) if you use the pipeline.

The Power Pixels pipeline combines several packages and workflows into one end-to-end pipeline. It supports Neuropixel 1.0 and 2.0 probes recorded on a National Instruments system (tested on NI PIXe-1071 with a BNC-2110 breakout board for synchronization channels) using SpikeGLX. 

This pipeline is nothing new! It's all about combining existing modules and pipelines into one, which is especially useful for people who are just starting out doing Neuropixel recordings and maybe have heard of all these tools but need some help getting them all integrated. Power Pixels relies on these amazing open-source projects:
- [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io)
- [ibllib](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib)
- [Kilosort](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort)
- [Universal Probe Finder](https://github.com/JorritMontijn/UniversalProbeFinder)
- [Bombcell](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell)
- [UnitRefine](https://huggingface.co/SpikeInterface/UnitRefine_sua_mua_classifier)

## Description of the pipeline elements

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc39ebc8-2729-4a97-aedc-15498729629c)

The pipeline contains the following elements:
- **Optional manual step: notch filters**: high-frequency noise in specific frequency bands can be filtered out using notch filters targeted to the frequency where the noise is present. 
- **Phase shift correction**: channels on a Neuropixel probe are not recorded simultaneously, there is a small (30 microsecond) delay between the acquisition of a block of channels. Correcting for this small delay greatly improves artifact removal at the "Destriping" step.
- **Remove bad channels**: bad channels are detected by looking at both coherence with other channels and PSD power in the high-frequency range, then they are interpolated using neighboring channels. Channels outside of the brain are removed.
- **Destriping or CAR**: For single shank 1.0 probes: removes electrical artifacts by applying a high pass spatial filter over the depth of the probe. For 4-shank 2.0 probes: apply a common average reference.
- **Spike sorting**: a spike sorting algorithm is used to detect spikes and sort them into units. SpikeInterface supports many [spike sorters](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/sorters.html#supported-spike-sorters) out of the box 
- **Synchronization**: each Neuropixel probe and the BNC breakout box has their own clock. This means one has to synchronize the spike times between the probes (if you use more than one) and the synchronization channels which carry timestamps of events (for example: behavioral events or pulses from a camera).
- **Compression**: the raw binary file is compressed using *mtscomp* which results in a 2-3x reduction in file size.
- **Histological tracing**: the fluorescent tracks of the probes are traced using the Universal Probe Finder package.
- **Ephys-histology alignment**: the brain regions along the probe, inferred from the tracing, are aligned to electrophysiological features.

## Installation

It is recommended to install Power Pixels in an Anaconda or Miniforge environment.
1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) - Miniforge is the recommended option
2. Open the Anaconda or Miniforge prompt
3. Install git by typing ```conda install git``` or ```mamba install git``` depending on whether you use Anaconda or Miniforge, respectively
4. Navigate to the location on your computer you want the repository to be and clone the repository by typing ```git clone https://github.com/NeuroNetMem/PowerPixelsPipeline```
5. Additonally clone the iblapps repository ```git clone https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblapps/```
6. Create the environment from the provided YML file by typing ```conda env create -f environment.yml``` or ```mamba env create -f environment.yml```
7. You can now activate the environment by typing ```conda activate powerpixels```
8. Install the iblapps repository by typing `pip install -e iblapps`

### Spike sorter
To install a spike sorter there are two options: (1) directly install Kilosort4 in the python environment, or (2) use Docker to run the spike sorter in a container. Note: if you want to use a MATLAB-based spike sorter (like Kilosort 2.5) you will have to pick option 2. 

_Option 1: local installation of Kilosort4_
1. In a terminal window activate the ``spikeinterface`` environment
2. Install Kilosort4 by typing ``pip install kilosort``
3. Remove the CPU version of PyTorch by typing ``pip uninstall torch``
4. Install the GPU version of PyTorch (for CUDA 11.8) with ``pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118``.

_Option 2: run spike sorter in Docker_
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
3. Install WSL2
4. Open a PowerShell terminal and type ```wsl --install```

### Universal Probe Finder
Altough most pipeline elements are python-based, the histological tracing is done using a MATLAB package so unfortunatly you will need a MATLAB license for this. Install the Universal Probe Finder by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/JorritMontijn/UniversalProbeFinder). In short: first do ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/JorritMontijn/UniversalProbeFinder``` and add with subfolders to the MATLAB path.

## First time use
After installing all the necessary components you can set up your pipeline for use.
1. Open your Anaconda or Miniforge prompt.
2. Activate your environment by typing ```conda activate powerpixels```
3. Navigate to where you cloned the repository.
4. Generate setting JSON files ```python PowerPixelsPipeline\generate_json_files.py```.
5. Open settings.json and fill in your settings (explanations of each item can be found in generate_setting_files.py).
6. Open nidq.wiring.json and fill in the synchronization channels you have in use. If you use multiple probes and/or the BNC breakout box you will need to use the 1Hz square wave pulse which is generated by the NIDQ to synchronize them. 
7. (Optional) If you are planning on using a spike sorter other than Kilosort 2.5, 3, or 4, you can generate the parameter file for this sorter by typing ```python PowerPixelsPipeline\get_default_sorter_params.py -s SPIKE_SORTER``` in which SPIKE_SORTER should be the sorter you want to use (see [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/sorters.html#supported-spike-sorters) for all options). The default parameter file for your sorter will appear in the spikesorter_param_file folder and you can adjust any parameters you wish in there.

*Recommended parameters for Kilosort 2.5, 3, and 4 are provided in the spikesorter_param_files folder, you can change these if you want but bear in mind that, because they come with the repository, they will be overwritten when you pull any new changes from the repo.*

## Folder structure
The pipeline is in principle agnostic to how your data is organized at a high level. The session folder can have any name and can be located anywhere in your top level data directory. However, each session folder does need to abide by some formatting requirements. Inside each session folder there needs to be a raw_ephys_data folder in which should be the output folder of SpikeGLX or OpenEphys. For the pipeline to find which session folder to process you need to create a process_me.flag file and put it in the session folder.
```
â”œâ”€â”€ session_folder
|   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_ephys_data
â””â”€â”€ process_me.flag
```
To facilitate the process you can run the helper function `python PowerPixelsPipeline\prepare_sessions.py` which creates the folders and flags for you (optional).

## Data output format
The data that comes out of the Power Pixels pipeline is in [ALF filenaming convention](https://int-brain-lab.github.io/ONE/alf_intro.html). A helper function is included to load in your neural data `load_neural_data` in `powerpixel_utils.py`.

## OpenEphys support
If you use OpenEphys, check out the [OpenEphys branch](https://github.com/NeuroNetMem/PowerPixelsPipeline/tree/openephys). Bear in mind that all of the SpikeGLX specific functionality is missing. Specifically, all the prepocessing steps (phase shift correction, remove bad channels, destriping or CAR) and the spike sorting work. However, all the steps after spike sorting will not work (synchronization, neuron-level QC, and compression). Also the ephys-histology alignment GUI relies on output from SpikeGLX specific code so will not work. 

## Usage workflow

1. Before starting a recording prepare the folder structure, either manually or by running `python PowerPixelsPipeline\prepare_sessions.py`. 
2. Perform your Neuropixel recording and make sure the output folder of SpikeGLX is one of the probe folders in raw_ephys_data.
3. Have a look at the raw data of your recording with the `visualize_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.
4. If there are peaks in the power spectrum of your recording that you want to filter out during the preprocessing, copy the `notch_filter.json` file to the probe folder and adjust the parameters so that you filter out the frequencies you want.
5. Start the pipeline by running the command `python PowerPixelsPipeline\run_pipeline_spikeglx.py`, this will search your top-level data folder for any sessions that have the process_me.flag. The pipeline will take a long time to run so best to do it overnight. After the pipeline has run there will be new probe folders for each of the probes in the top-level of the session folder which contain the spike sorted data and other quality metrics.
7. After you've done your histology, launch Universal Probe Finder in MATLAB and do the Slice Prepper and Slice Finder steps to trace your probe insertions (you can skip Probe Finder).
8. To transform the tracks to something the alignment GUI can read run the `convert_histology_to_alignment_GUI.m` script in MATLAB. This will save .json files for all the tracks you traced in Universal Probe Finder.
9. Match these tracks to the recorded probes and move the .json files to the corresponsing probe folders that were created by the pipeline. Once it's in the correct probe folder, rename the .json file to `xyz_picks.json`.
10. Launch the alignment gui by typing `python iblapps\atlaselectrophysiology\ephys_atlas_gui.py -o True`, see instructions on how to use the GUI [here](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblapps/wiki/2.-Usage-instructions).
11. After the alignment is done click Upload and the final channel locations and brain regions will be saved in the `channel_locations.json` file.
12. You can do manual curation of the spike sorting output by running in a python terminal:
    ```
    from powerpixels import manual_curation
    manual_curation("path\to\sorting\results")
    ```
    The SpikeInterface manual curation GUI will launch which will include the automatic classification output from Bombcell, UnitRefine and the IBL. You can use the GUI to manually annote units as good, or you can use it to see which one of the automated classification metrics you like and use one of those. They are loaded in together with the neural data so you can easily use them to filter units to use.
13. You can load in the neural data of your recording with a supplied helper function like this:
    ```
    from powerpixels import load_neural_data
    spikes, clusters, channels = load_neural_data(session_path, probe)
    ```
15. That's it, enjoy your beautiful data!
